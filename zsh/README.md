## ZSH

### my.zshrc

I have defined these aliases:

* f='find . | grep --color'
* nr='npm run'
* dn='dotnet'
* d-c='docker-compose'
* gt='git tree'

I use these plugins:
* Mac: git osx z ssh-agent brew colored-man
* Linux: git z ssh-agent colored-man

To switch directory, `z` is really awesome.

And I puth machine specific settings into `~/.zshenv`

### Features of txchen.zsh-theme

* Super fast git/hg branch showing
* Show exit code if it was not zero
* Random hostname color in prompt, based on md5 hash
